# Tidy Dataset of Mean and Std Values

## Data from: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset


    The R script contained in this repo will read in the training and test
datasets from Samsung's *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset*
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and write out a tidy data set containing the average for the meand and
standard deviation values for each of the 30 subjects and the 6 activities
they perform.

  The name of this script is run_analysis.R and it is invoked in R as: run_analysis()

  Assumptions:
    1) The training, test, subject, features and activity name data is availablein the same director from which the run_analysis() script is run. 

  The tidy dataset is arranged as: TBD
